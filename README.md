# Garbage Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques

This repository contains the Flutter Application Source code which is used to build the Garbage Detection App. This project implements an application which detects the presence of garbage in the image clicked by the user through smartphone. The main provocation behind this initiative was to raise awareness among users to maintain a clean and hygienic environment by detecting garbage on the street and informing local municipalities. That in turn would help them in the process of keeping our neighborhood clean.

The objective of this research is to create an optimized model to decrease the human intervention and rely more on technology for more productive and cost-effective process.
